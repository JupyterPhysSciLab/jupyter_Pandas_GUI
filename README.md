#### Introduction:

This package provides GUI tools to help the user construct Pandas and Python 
expressions 
to create things such as new calculated columns, plots or fits. The tools are 
meant to run in an interactive Jupyter notebook in 
[classic Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). All tools are based on ipywidgets widgets.

These tools are meant to help the user learn how to construct the commands. 
They are intended for new or occasional users of Pandas. However, 
sophisticated users may find them useful for doing simple one-off tasks where 
the ability to choose python objects from menus can reduce errors.

#### Current Features:

The user can pass the GUI tools a list of Pandas 
DataFrames to work with. If nothing is passed, the GUI will look for 
Pandas DataFrames in the interactive session. The whole GUI and the Jupyter 
cell that created it are deleted when done. This leaves only the code that was 
generated by the GUI and the results of running the generated code.

The generated code contains sparse comments meant to help new users 
understand the code.

*Currently defined GUIs:*

* `new_pandas_column_GUI()`: A GUI with four steps to lead the user through 
  formulating an expression for a new column.

* `plot_pandas_GUI()`: A GUI with four steps to lead the user through plotting 
  Pandas data as a scatter or line plot using plotly.

* `fit_pandas_GUI()`: A GUI with six steps to lead the user through fitting 
  Pandas data to a line, polynomial, exponential, Gaussian or sine function.

#### Wishlist:

  * GUIs for plots beyond scatter/line plots.
  
#### Usage:
If the `jupyter_Pandas_GUI` is installed in your Jupyter/Python environment 
start by importing it:
```
from pandas_GUI import *
```
When you want to use a particular GUI issue the appropriate command. Currently:
```
new_pandas_column_GUI()
```
or
```
plot_pandas_GUI()
```
or
```
fit_pandas_GUI()
```
See the [documentation
](https://jupyterphysscilab.github.io/jupyter_Pandas_GUI/) for examples,
more details and information about passing dataframes that are not at the
root of the interactive namespace or presenting the user with alternative names
for the dataframes. There is also an option to make columns containing text 
available. By default they are ignored.


#### Installation:

Installation using pip into a virtual environment is recommended.

*Production*

1. If not installed, install pipenv:`$ pip3 install --user pipenv`. You may
need to add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` to make `pipenv`
available in your command shell. More discussion: 
[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).
1. Navigate to the directory where this package will be installed.
1. Start a shell in the environment `$ pipenv shell`.
1. Install using pip.
    1. `pip install jupyter-Pandas-GUI`. This will install 
       Jupyter into the same virtual
    environment if you do not already have it on your machine. If Jupyter is already
    installed the virtual environment will use the existing installation. This takes
    a long time on a Raspberry Pi. It will not run on a 3B+ without at least 1 GB of
    swap. See: [Build Jupyter on a Pi
   ](https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/gutow/computer-and-programming-how-tos/installing-jupyter-on-raspberrian).
    2. Still within the environment shell test this by starting jupyter
`jupyter notebook` or `Jupyter lab`. The version of Jupyter requested should 
       launch in your browser.
        1. Open a new notebook using the default (Python 3) kernel.
        1. In the first cell import the pandas_GUI module:
            `from pandas_GUI import *`
        1. To try:
           1. Create some Pandas DataFrames in the notebook.
           1. Use the command `new_pandas_column_GUI()` to start the GUI.
           1. It will search for the DataFrames you created.
           1. Follow the steps to create a new column in one of your
              DataFrames.
        
1. _Optional_ You can make this environment available to an alternate Jupyter install as a special kernel when you are the user.
    1. Make sure you are running in your virtual environment `$ pipenv shell` in the directory for  virtual
    environment will do that.
    1. Issue the command to add this as a kernel to your personal space: 
    `$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<name-you-want-for-kernel>`.
    1. More information is available in the Jupyter/Ipython documentation. A simple tutorial from Nikolai Jankiev
    (_Parametric Thoughts_) can be found [here](https://janakiev.com/til/jupyter-virtual-envs/). 
    
*Development*

Simply replace `$ pip install jupyter-Pandas-GUI` with `$ pip 
install -e ../jupyter_Pandas_GUI` in the _Production_
instructions.

#### Change Log
* 0.7.0rc1
  * GUIs now also work in Google Colab and Jupyter Lab, although less 
    elegently than in classic Jupyter. Range selection for fitting not yet 
    supported in Colab.
  * Some minor bug fixes and clarification of instructions.
  * More and better comments in generated code.
  * Replacement of notebook cell javascript tools with those from JPSLUtils 
    is complete.
* 0.6.2.1 Fix for python move of `Iterable` to `collections.abc`
* 0.6.2
  * Can now pass dataframes to the GUIs and they will search for additional 
    dataframes in the user namespace. Search can be turned off.
  * Fixed edge case where GUI fit range picking did nothing.
* 0.6.1 fixed `fit_pandas_GUI()` mishandling of user friendly names for the 
  data frames.
* 0.6.0
  * Documentation (Examples and API).
  * Addition of fitting GUI.
  * Minor bug and typo fixes.
  * Images show up on Pypi page.
* 0.5.2 
  * Widget states autosaved when a new plot is made.
  * Began making use of [JPSLUtils](https://github.com/JupyterPhysSciLab/JPSLUtils).  
* 0.5.1
  * Possible to use pandas dataframes in namespaces other than the
    user global namespace.
  * Readme updates.
* 0.5.0 Initial beta release.
