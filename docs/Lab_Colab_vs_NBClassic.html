<h1>Pandas GUI behavior in Lab and Colab versus Classic Jupyter</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The examples in the documentation are all based on how the GUI tools work
    in the classic
    Jupyter notebook environment. If you are using these tools in
    <a href = "https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a> or
    <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> keep in
    mind the differences in behavior described below.</p>
<h2>Differences common to Lab and Colab</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rather then generate the code directly in a notebook cell
        immediately below the tabbed GUI, the code is generated in an
        editable textarea below the tabbed GUI. See the image below for
        the <code>new_pandas_column_GUI()</code>.</li>
    <image src = "DataSets/new_col_in_Colab.png"></image>
    <li>If you wish the generated code to persist after cell outputs are
        cleared, the generated code needs to be manually copied to a code
        cell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the code in Lab and Colab</h2>
<uL>
    <li><span style="color:blue;">In Colab</span> the code can be run by
        clicking on the "run code" button and the results will appear in
        the output of the cell.</li>
    <li><span style="color:red;">In Lab</span> clicking on the "run code"
        button will output the results to the log console,
        which defaults to appearing at the bottom of the window. To make
        the results appear in the output of a notebook cell the code must
        be copied to a cell and the cell run.</li>
