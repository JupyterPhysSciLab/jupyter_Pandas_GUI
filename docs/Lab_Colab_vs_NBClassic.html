<h1>Pandas GUI behavior in Lab and Colab versus Classic Jupyter</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The examples in the documentation are all based on how the GUI tools work
    in the classic
    Jupyter notebook environment. If you are using these tools in
    <a href = "https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a> or
    <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> keep in
    mind the differences in behavior described below.</p>
<h2>Differences common to Lab and Colab</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rather then generate the code directly in a notebook cell
        immediately below the tabbed GUI, the code is generated in an
        editable textarea below the tabbed GUI. See the image below for
        the <code>new_pandas_column_GUI()</code>.</li>

    <li>If you wish the generated code to persist after cell outputs are
        cleared, the generated code needs to be manually copied to a code
        cell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the code in Lab and Colab</h2>
<p>The code can be run by clicking on the "run code" button and the results
    will appear in the output of the cell. To make sure that the results can be
    reproduced if the cell outputs are cleard, copy the code that was run
    from the collapsed "code that was run" summary to a separate code cell.</p>
